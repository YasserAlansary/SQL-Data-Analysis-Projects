# Sql-Data-Analysis projects

1- Covid-19-virus: In these projects, I analyse data from Covid 19 to determine the most affected countries, continents, and total number of affected people and deaths, as well as the number of vaccinated and which country has the highest number of vaccinated people and a lot of important informations.
2-coursera: In these projects, I analysed data about E-learning sites such as coursera, udemy, datacamp, and similar sites, as well as data about website stages of development and how they can be the best sites in the market, as well as finding the best courses and certifications for various levels of experience and knowledge.
